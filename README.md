This was the final assignment for the Coursera course SQL FOR DATA SCIENCE. The assignment was designed to test the student's knowledge of a wide range of concepts and SQL design techniques discussed throughout the course. For this assignment, specifically, the students had to play the role of a real-world data scientist using SQL to both answer specific questions for an organization and make inferences based on their discoveries. 

The dataset used is from Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.
